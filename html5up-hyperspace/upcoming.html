							<p>With some trust that we will continue to persevere through the COVID-19 Pandemic and if the Kent District Library system continues to graciously have us we hope to hold in-person programs at a KDL cite in August 2022, and December 2022. Exact dates and details to come. If you would like us to visit a library near you, email us at __!</p>
                            <p>This will be a course to introduce students to the world of programming, using the Python 3 language. A curriculum written by our curriculum development team will be used. By the end of the course students will have gained a fundamental understanding of programming as well as basic skills in Python such as notions of primitive types, variables, strings, lists, dictionaries, for- and while- loops, and functions. Students will also complete a mini-project towards the end to utilize what they learned as well as showcase their learning. Prerequisites: basic arithmetic skills.</p>
